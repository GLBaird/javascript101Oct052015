// this is an example of a single line comment, where only one line of text can be a comment only, this is not affected by textwrap, which your text editor may invoke, if a line of text, like this, is very long.

/*
	This is an example of a multiline comment
	This comment can be as many lines as you like, and is containted between the
	forward-slash and asterix
	Unline the single line comment, you can use hard returns to seperate the lines
	of comment, and therefore, not need to rely on text editor to have a wordwrap facility.
