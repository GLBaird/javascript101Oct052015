        <p>This is a very simple HTML document with some javascript
        	that has been hidden from the view of older browsers
            by using an HTML Comment.</p>
        <p>Browsers will ignore all comments between &lt;!-- and --&gt;.
        	Whereas JS will ignor the following two lines only:</p>
      	<ul>
        	<li>&lt;!--</li>
            <li>// --&gt;</li>
     	</ul>
