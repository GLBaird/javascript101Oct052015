    	<h1>A simple onClick event</h1>
        <p>We are going to add a simple onClick event to the next paragraph,
           so that if the user clicks on it, they will see an alert box appear.
           This can be used to set conditionals onto links and other such advanced
           confirmation testing or function changing things.</p>
