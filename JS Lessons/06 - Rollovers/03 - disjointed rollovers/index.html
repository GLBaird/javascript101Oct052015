    	<h1>Disjointed Rollovers - Mondial House, London</h1>
        <p>We are now looking at disjointed rollovers, where a link
        can trigger a change in an image which is not containted within
        the tag.  Here we have a selection of images of Mondial House in London.</p>
        <p>Mondial House was built by BT in the late 1970s and took 5 years to complete.
        It was designed as a gigantic supercomputer using white plastic, and was
        full of machines and telephony equipment for linking the world as BT's flagship
        international telephone exchange. Sadly it was demolished in 2006 to make way
        for a bland block of offices made from chrome and glass.</p>
