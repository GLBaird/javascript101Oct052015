    	<h1>Better Rollover Example</h1>
        <p>Instead of using the simple HTML based technique, which can cause
           loading problems, it is much better to use a proper script to make
           using rollovers quicker and easier to code, as well as give a better
           user experience by proloading before the page is displayed.</p>
